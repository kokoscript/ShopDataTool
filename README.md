# ShopDataTool

Command generator for Minecraft commandblock shops

## Purpose

Before I realized using 720 command blocks to create a shop is absurd, I created this script to generate all the commands needed to create the shop for my private Minecraft server.
We switched it to Spigot with a shop plugin in the end, so this ended up never being used. So, I decided to archive it here as an example of how hacky my code can get.
